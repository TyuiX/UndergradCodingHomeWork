Zadeh was enrolled in Alborz College, which was a Presbyterian missionary school, where he was educated for the next eight years, and where he met his future wife, Fay.[24] Zadeh says that he was \ndeeply influenced by the extremely decent, fine, honest and helpful\n missionaries from the United States who ran the college. \nTo me they represented the best that you could find in the United States – people from the Midwest with strong roots. They were really 'Good Samaritans' – willing to give of themselves for the benefit of others. So this kind of attitude influenced me deeply. It also instilled in me a deep desire to live in the United States.\n During this time, Zadeh was awarded several patents.");
